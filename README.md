CUDAworks
=========

This project is about simple codes and applications in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).

At present there is one directory 'proj_0' in which heat equation is solved in single dimension. This shows the CPU and GPU comparison for large array computations.

The machine used has NVIDIA Graphics card with Compute Capability 3.0. For building the project, 'make' should be installed. Changes may be made appropriately in the 'heat' target section for proper compilation if a much different CUDA machine is used.
